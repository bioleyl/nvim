## Installing a Nerd Font

We need to use a Nerd Font as our WSL terminal font. Otherwise, certain icons in Neovim will just look like: ▯. In my case, I downloaded the JetBrainsMono Nerd Font (download here). Once the download was completed, I unzipped the directory, selected all the fonts, and right-clicked my selection. This lets you choose the option to “Install all” the fonts.

To use the Nerd Font in our Windows Terminal:

- Open up Settings ctrl ,
- Open the tray by clicking the three-lines icon on the top left
- Click Ubuntu under Profiles to open its profile settings
- Scroll down to Additional Settings and click Appearance
- Change Font face to JetBrainsMono Nerd Font
